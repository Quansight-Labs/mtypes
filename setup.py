DESCRIPTION = """\
Meta-class of type that extends Python type system to create dtype-like memory-types\
"""

LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
Overview
--------

The "mtypes" package provides a memory-type system suitable for use by any container, object, or 
library where the memory-layout matters.

Specifically it creates a new sub-class of type at the CPython layer so that every mtype is a type
but with special function pointers needed for manipulating the raw memory that the type implies.
